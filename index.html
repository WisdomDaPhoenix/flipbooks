<!-- This represents a jQuery selector targeting an HTML element where the FlowPaper viewer will be embedded.
Replace div with a specific selector, like "#viewer" (for an element with ID viewer) or ".pdf-container" (for a class).
.FlowPaperViewer():

This is a method provided by the FlowPaper library to initialize the viewer.
It requires a configuration object as its parameter to define how the viewer behaves.
config Object:

Contains settings for the FlowPaper viewer.
PDFFile: Specifies the path to the PDF file to be displayed. In this example, "Paper.pdf" is the file being loaded.
How It Works
HTML Setup:

You need an HTML element (e.g., <div id="viewer"></div>) as the container for the FlowPaper viewer.
FlowPaper Library:

Ensure the FlowPaper JavaScript and CSS files are included in your project, typically through <script> and <link> tags.
jQuery Dependency:

FlowPaper relies on jQuery, so include jQuery before using .FlowPaperViewer().
PDF Loading:

The viewer fetches and displays the PDF file (Paper.pdf) inside the specified container.
